# SEC Mutual Funds Investment Monitor

## Project Description

This project involves creating a Flask web application that allows users to search and retrieve information about mutual fund investments from the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) website. The application integrates with the SEC's EDGAR database to provide detailed information on mutual fund investments, allowing users to monitor and analyze their portfolios.

## Features

### 1. Flask Application Setup

- **Basic Setup**: A robust Flask application framework has been created.
- **User Authentication**: Includes Signup and Login functionality with user session management.
- **Navigation Tabs**: Features intuitive tabs for easy navigation, including Home, Fund Search, Favorites, Monitor, and Profile sections.

### 2. Integration with SEC.gov

- **EDGAR Database Connection**: The project connects to the SEC's EDGAR database to fetch and display data related to mutual funds.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for mutual fundsâ€™ investments through the web interface.
- **Data Retrieval**: Retrieve detailed information about mutual funds, including submissions, holdings, and more.

### 3. User Features

- **Home Page**: View and search for mutual fund investments. The page displays well-known funds and RSS feed updates about the latest submissions from SEC.gov.
- **Fund Search**: Perform searches for mutual funds.
- **Monitor**: View information about the latest fund submissions, including a table of current fund positions and the ability to track how a fund's portfolio changes over the last five submissions. Users can understand whether a fund has maintained, added, or liquidated positions based on share amounts. Funds can be managed using radio buttons, with the fund list sourced from favorites.
- **Favorites**: Add and manage favorite funds for quick access.
- **Profile**: Update your profile information and manage your account.

**Note**: Users who are not logged in can access the Home and About pages. They can perform fund searches but cannot add to favorites or monitor funds. Users who sign up will gain full access to all features.
